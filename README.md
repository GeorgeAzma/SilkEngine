# Silk Engine

Silk Engine is meant to be abstraction of vulkan, which makes it easy to get stuff on the screen, it's in early development, but has basic functionalities:
- Instanced mesh/model renderer
- Entity component system
- Abstractions classes for vulkan objects which automate lots of annoying vulkan stuff (like descriptors)
- Lots of utility functions for game/app development
- Easier to create custom meshes
- Easy to get rectangle on the screen just add rectangle MeshComponent to an entity (in future I will add drawRectangle() like function)

I do not recommend using this engine for anything serious, but you can use this if you are annoyed how many things vulkan makes you keep track of and you just wanna start rendering and get things done
