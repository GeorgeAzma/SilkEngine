Windows Only:

	Run "build.bat"

	Or 

	Open SilkEngine Folder via visual studio
	Press: "Project -> Configure SilkEngine"
	Press: "Project -> Build" (Takes a while)
	Press: "Project -> Configure SilkEngine" Again

SilkEngine is now built.

Now you need to create new project in "src" folder,
set that as a startup target from visual studio and run it.
For example to how to do that go to: 
"templates/src" folder
